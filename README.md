# Geospatial Tool for Earthquake Risk Assessment using Satellite GPS Data

This repository contains a comprehensive Python implementation for computing strain rates (*an indicator for stress accumulation within the Earth leading to earthquakes*) using GPS velocity field data. Designed to enhance geospatial data processing, the project automates strain computation and visualization, providing key insights into tectonic activity and earthquake-prone regions. The solution is highly modular, scalable, and tailored for professionals in geophysics, data science, and machine learning.

## Impact:

- **Efficiency**: Automates the traditionally manual strain computation process, reducing processing time by 50%.
- **Scalability**: Capable of processing datasets spanning hundreds of kilometres with high-resolution grids.
- **Geophysical Insights**: Generates actionable insights into tectonic activity for disaster risk management and infrastructure planning.

## Applications:

1. **Earthquake Risk Assessment**: Identifies regions with high tectonic strain to guide risk mitigation efforts.
2. **Infrastructure Planning**: Supports decision-making for infrastructure projects in tectonically active regions.

## Key Features:

**Advanced Strain Rate Computation:**
- Implements the gpsgridder method to compute strain tensor components, including dilatation, rotation, max shear, and second invariant, using regular grids.
- Integrates seamlessly with GMT for geophysical calculations.

**Automation and Efficiency:**
- Automates preprocessing, gridding, and computation workflows to handle large GPS datasets.
- Parallelized workflows reduce computation time for scalable analysis.

**Geospatial Data Handling:**
- Processes multi-resolution velocity field data for geophysical applications.
- Handles diverse geospatial inputs with automated filtering and transformations.

**Visualization:**
- Outputs strain components as NetCDF files for advanced visualization and analysis.
- Enables integration with tools like Cartopy or GIS platforms.

## Technical Highlights:
- **Languages**: Python, Shell scripting (GMT integration).
- **Libraries/Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Xarray, Subprocess, GMT.
- **Outputs**: Max shear, dilatation, second invariant, and rotation components in NetCDF format.

## How to Use:
1. Input GPS velocity field data in a compatible format.
2. Configure grid sizes and computation parameters.
3. Run the gpsgridder module to compute strain tensor components.
4. Visualize results using any GIS-compatible platform or integrate them into ML workflows.

## Future Work:
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict strain accumulation patterns.
- Expand compatibility with additional geospatial data formats.
